1. From the code we wrote, is this the proper 'Makerkit' or good way to handle
   data fetching, maniuplation and form validation.

2. How do we actually use i18n and when would we use it?

3. How is the auth working? For example in the supabase table view there are a
   bunch of different tables related to it, also how do we configure auth?

4. How do we write seed file to create an admin/authed account?

5. Who is going to make this repo (aka add the staterkit in) and how is the
   gitflow going to be are we going to be creating branches and merging or
   rebasing.
